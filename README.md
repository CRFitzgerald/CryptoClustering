# CryptoClustering
In this challenge, I used Python and unsupervised learning to predict whether cryptocurrencies are affected by 1-day or 7-day price changes.
### Tools Used
* sklearn
* Principal Compenent Analysis - PCA
* hvplot
* Python
* Pandas
Using the above tools, I was able to do the following:
1. Using original data, find best value for k
2. Using original data, leverage K-Means to cluster cryptocurrencies
3. Using PCA, optimize clusters
4. Using PCA data, find best value for k
5. Using PCA data, leverage K-Means to cluster cryptocurrencies
6. Using hvPlot, create composite plots to visually compare results
